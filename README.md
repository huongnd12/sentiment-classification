# Text Classification: Sentiment Analysis

The project aims to build classification model for sentiment analysis.

The dataset NTC-SCV is trained on:
1. Multi-layer Perceptron Model (MLP) with the EmbeddingBag vector representation. Evaluation on MLP is compred to evaluations on other vector representation techniques which are Bag-of-Word (BoW) and TF-IDF
2. TextCNN Model with the Embedding vector representation
   
NTC-SCV dataset includes Vietnamses reviews and comments. It contains 30000 training samples, 10000 validation samples and 10000 testing samples. Two classes are labeled as Negative and Positive.
